## Installation
In order to install the game the user has to download the .zip file from github and open it in the compiler of choice (we recommand using VsCode
for maximal compatibility).

## Getting Started
After you open the file in VsCode, the SideScrollerGame.java needs to be runned.

## Gameplay
After you run the .java file, a menu will appear, from the options menu the volume of the background music can be adjusted. After the button New Game is pressed, 
the game will start playing. You have a few seconds to get ready and see the first platforms spawning as the game is very fast paced. Once the game starts you have to 
avoi getting hit by the platforms, use them to jump and collect the coins, be aware of the spikes. You can also use double jump. The coins collected will be displayed 
in the uper right corner of the screen. If the character gets hit by spikes, you will lose life points from the lifebar displayed in the upper center of the screen. If 
the user will score a new high score, the game will ask for a user name and will save your progress. If you lose all your life points, or get hit by a platform, the game 
ends and a retry screen will appear.
